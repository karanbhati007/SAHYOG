# SAHYOG

We SAHYOG as a team aim to start a culture through means of technology where people who want to act as a volunteer, a philanthropist or merely a helper could easily contact or reach any person who seeks help. "DOING NOTHING FOR OTHERS is like Undoing of ourselves" and Sahyog with means of its dual interface for a helper and a seeker tries to establish a connection between them by means of this app where you can post about any kind of help like distributing ration , clothes, food, shelter can be selected and can be posted just similiar to a facebook post type notification on this mobile application and anyone who needs one of the helps as mentioned can reach the helper by means of our tracking and routing system to that location or can establish a contact with him more over we have a super additional feature where admin panel can be controlled by a central authority or a govt official who can supervise volunteer service and can navigate helpers to areas where people are vulnerable. We also specify a maximum and minimum radius where a helper can reach a needy which can be set by by our own convienience and is 15 km by default, Small gestures of kindness can lead to a global impact and as we know in the current crisis and present situation during the pandemic it was a mismtach about information , about facilities and about food and basic amenities where people suffered a lot with means of this app we also aim to surpass trusted Information through means of the posts and also eradicate the fear of Fake Whatsapp university , by means of this all in one mobile application we can start a new trend and revoltionize volunteer and philanthropy after all who knows when the next pandemic or epidemic hits us .
